2 - Only after we have the HTML file complete we start to add the styles.
 -we will have an css file for each screen type. 
 -we will start styling the mobile version first
 -we will use first come first served---the one who starts to write code will take the first task or section we need to do at the time and 
 and let the others know you started on that task! 
 -we use ARIAL font and the colors i provided in the chat for now so we can start the styling and we can always reconsider later on those
 3 - we start style for the desktop version when we have the most acurate version of the mobile done
