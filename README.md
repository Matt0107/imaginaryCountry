# Veal
------

### Introduction

This is the first project of five Wild Code School Web Development bootcamp students. We started creating it within our first month and therefor there was only limited knowledge to work with. However we gave our best to implement various features we found online.
This is why the code you will see on the css and js files might seem chaotic and we are still on the process improving them.


### Description

The project about a website to an imaginary country called "Veal". It's goal is to: 
- make it easy to choose Veal as a travel destination,
- solve the problem of other various crowded travel websites or blogs by providing minimal, accurate and objective information.
- promote a more sustainable form of travel.

### Initial design

We choose the approach of `less is more` for the website. Meaning that we do only show limited information and photos to make it easy to follow and awake curiosity in general.
Here is a link to the mockup that we designed in the beginning of the project: *https://www.figma.com/file/JyaTMJgbUV9CR2jYDHOwyh/Travelling-Website-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1*.



### Contribution
----
If you compare the mockup with the current version of the website, you will notice some changes. 
However there is still a room for improvement to make it more user-friendly, accessible and more stylish in general. 

Feel free to fork and work on the design ideas you might think would make the website more *beautiful*. We are open to new ideas and we would appreciate any collaboration and help you might provide!

We feel that with the collaboration of the Github community, there is a potential to this project!
